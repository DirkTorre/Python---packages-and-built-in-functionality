# What is this?

I wanted to have something like a reference for Python code snippets and sorts.
So I created this repository both for learning and creating useful reference code.
There are a bunch of packages that I want to learn more about.

I will all place it in here and put it on github, so hopefully someone, someday might find it useful.
(Or so that I won't accidentally lose this folder.)
